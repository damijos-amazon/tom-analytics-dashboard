# 🎉 DYNAMIC TABLES IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## ✅ EVERYTHING IS WIRED AND OPERATIONAL

### What Was Done

1. **Removed ALL Hardcoded Tables**
   - Deleted 6 hardcoded table sections from HTML
   - Deleted 6 hardcoded podium sections
   - Replaced with single `<div id="tables-container">`

2. **Dynamic Table System Fully Functional**
   - ✅ Tables generated from `assets/table-config.json`
   - ✅ Podiums auto-generated for each table
   - ✅ File routing based on filename patterns
   - ✅ Drag & drop fully operational
   - ✅ All calculations and algorithms INTACT

3. **Files Synced Between Root and Demo**
   - ✅ `js/table-config-system.js`
   - ✅ `js/file-routing-engine.js`
   - ✅ `js/dynamic-table-generator.js`
   - ✅ `js/dashboard-manager.js`
   - ✅ `js/config-modal.js`
   - ✅ `assets/table-config.json`
   - ✅ `index.html`

## 🎯 Drag & Drop Flow (VERIFIED)

```
User drops file
    ↓
window.dashboards['tableBody'].routeFilesToTables(files)
    ↓
FileRoutingEngine.routeFile(file) matches filename
    ↓
Returns target tableId
    ↓
window.dashboards[tableBodyId].handleFileUpload([file])
    ↓
✅ File processed by correct table
```

## 📋 Configuration

All 6 tables configured in `assets/table-config.json`:
1. VTI Compliance (tableBody) - **FIRST TABLE** - Sets up drag & drop
2. VTI DPMO (tableBody2)
3. TA Idle Time (tableBody3)
4. Seal Validation (tableBody4)
5. PPO Compliance (tableBody5)
6. Andon Response Time (tableBody6)

## 🔧 How to Add New Tables

1. Open dashboard
2. Click "⚙️ Manage Tables" button
3. Click "+ Add New Table"
4. Fill in:
   - Table Name
   - Scoring Direction (higher/lower is better)
   - Default Benchmark
   - File Upload Patterns
5. Click "Save Table"
6. ✅ New table appears instantly with drag & drop working

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Drag & Drop
1. Open `index.html` or `demo/index.html`
2. Drag these files to upload area:
   - `prior-vti.xlsx` → VTI Compliance
   - `current-vti-dpmo.csv` → VTI DPMO
   - `prior-ta-idle-time.xlsx` → TA Idle Time
   - `current-seal-validation.csv` → Seal Validation
   - `prior-ppo-compliance.xlsx` → PPO Compliance
   - `current-andon-response-time.csv` → Andon Response Time

### Test Manage Tables
1. Click "⚙️ Manage Tables"
2. Try editing a table
3. Try hiding/showing a table
4. Try adding a new table
5. Try deleting a table (data is archived)
