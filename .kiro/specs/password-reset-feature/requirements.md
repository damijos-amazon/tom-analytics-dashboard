# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for adding password reset functionality to the TOM Analytics Dashboard authentication system. Currently, users can sign up and log in with email/password, but there is no way to reset a forgotten password. This feature will allow users to securely reset their passwords via email verification.

## Glossary

- **System**: The TOM Analytics Dashboard authentication system
- **User**: An authenticated person with an @amazon.com email address
- **Reset Link**: A time-limited URL sent via email that allows password reset
- **Reset Token**: A secure, single-use token embedded in the reset link
- **Email Service**: Supabase Auth email service for sending reset emails

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Password Reset Request

**User Story:** As a user who forgot my password, I want to request a password reset, so that I can regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a User clicks "Forgot Password" on the login page, THE System SHALL display a password reset request form
2. WHEN a User submits a valid @amazon.com email address, THE System SHALL send a password reset email to that address
3. WHEN a User submits an email that is not registered, THE System SHALL display a generic success message without revealing account existence
4. WHEN a User submits an invalid email format, THE System SHALL display "Please enter a valid email address"
5. WHEN the reset email is sent successfully, THE System SHALL display "If an account exists with this email, you will receive a password reset link shortly"

### Requirement 2: Password Reset Email

**User Story:** As a user who requested a password reset, I want to receive a secure reset link via email, so that I can create a new password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the System sends a password reset email, THE System SHALL include a unique reset token valid for 60 minutes
2. WHEN a User receives the reset email, THE System SHALL include a clickable link that redirects to the password reset page
3. WHEN the reset token expires, THE System SHALL prevent password reset and display "This reset link has expired"
4. WHEN a reset token is used successfully, THE System SHALL invalidate the token to prevent reuse
5. WHEN a User requests multiple resets, THE System SHALL invalidate previous tokens and send a new one

### Requirement 3: Password Reset Form

**User Story:** As a user with a valid reset link, I want to enter a new password, so that I can access my account again.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a User clicks a valid reset link, THE System SHALL display a password reset form with two password fields
2. WHEN a User enters a password shorter than 6 characters, THE System SHALL display "Password must be at least 6 characters long"
3. WHEN a User enters mismatched passwords in the two fields, THE System SHALL display "Passwords do not match"
4. WHEN a User submits a valid new password, THE System SHALL update the password and display "Password reset successful"
5. WHEN password reset succeeds, THE System SHALL redirect the User to the login page after 2 seconds

### Requirement 4: Security

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want password resets to be secure, so that unauthorized users cannot access my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a reset token is generated, THE System SHALL create a cryptographically secure token with at least 128 bits of entropy
2. WHEN a User attempts to use an invalid token, THE System SHALL display "Invalid or expired reset link"
3. WHEN a User attempts to use an expired token, THE System SHALL display "This reset link has expired. Please request a new one"
4. WHEN a password is reset successfully, THE System SHALL log the action in the audit log with timestamp and IP address
5. WHEN a reset is requested, THE System SHALL rate-limit requests to 3 attempts per email per hour

### Requirement 5: User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear guidance during the password reset process, so that I know what to do at each step.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a User is on the login page, THE System SHALL display a "Forgot Password?" link below the password field
2. WHEN a User submits a reset request, THE System SHALL display a loading indicator during processing
3. WHEN a User is on the reset password page, THE System SHALL display instructions explaining the process
4. WHEN a password reset fails, THE System SHALL display a clear error message with next steps
5. WHEN a password reset succeeds, THE System SHALL display a success message with automatic redirect countdown
