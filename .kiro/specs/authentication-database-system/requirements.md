# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds enterprise-grade authentication and database integration to the TOM Analytics Dashboard. The system will support SSO (Single Sign-On) authentication for unlimited managers, Supabase PostgreSQL database for data persistence, and a comprehensive admin panel for user management. The primary admin will have full control over user access, roles, and system configuration.

## Glossary

- **SSO (Single Sign-On)**: Authentication method that allows users to log in using their company credentials (Microsoft, Google, Okta)
- **Supabase**: Open-source Firebase alternative providing PostgreSQL database, authentication, and real-time subscriptions
- **Super Admin**: The primary administrator with full system control and ability to manage other admins
- **Admin**: Elevated user with ability to manage regular users but cannot manage other admins
- **Manager**: Regular user with access to view and edit employee data
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Database security feature that restricts data access based on user identity
- **Audit Log**: System log that tracks all user actions for security and compliance
