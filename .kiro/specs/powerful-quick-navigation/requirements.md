# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing and enhancing the existing quick navigation system on the TOM Analytics Dashboard. The current navigation has issues with collapsing/expanding functionality, broken scroll buttons, and needs proper organization with a "Benchmarks" section that contains all table links except the leaderboard.

## Glossary

- **Quick_Navigation_System**: The left-side navigation panel that provides quick access to dashboard sections
- **Navigation_Toggle**: The button or control that opens/closes the navigation panel
- **Benchmarks_Section**: A collapsible navigation group containing all benchmark table links
- **Table_Links**: Navigation items that scroll directly to specific table sections
- **Scroll_Buttons**: The "Go to Top" and "Go to Bottom" buttons for page navigation
- **Benchmark_Tables**: VTI Compliance, VTI DPMO, TA Idle Time, Seal Validation, PPO Compliance, and Andon Response Time tables
- **Leaderboard_Section**: The TOM Team Leaderboard section (separate from benchmarks)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want a collapsible navigation panel with proper toggle functionality, so that I can show or hide the navigation as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads, THE Quick_Navigation_System SHALL display in a collapsed state with a visible toggle button
2. WHEN a user clicks the navigation toggle, THE Quick_Navigation_System SHALL smoothly expand from the left side
3. WHEN the navigation panel is open and the toggle is clicked again, THE Quick_Navigation_System SHALL smoothly collapse back to the left
4. WHEN a user clicks outside the open navigation panel, THE Quick_Navigation_System SHALL automatically collapse
5. THE Navigation_Toggle SHALL remain visible and functional in both collapsed and expanded states

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want a "Benchmarks" section in the navigation that expands to show all benchmark tables, so that I can organize and access table navigation efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Quick_Navigation_System SHALL display "Benchmarks" as the first navigation item
2. WHEN a user clicks on "Benchmarks", THE Benchmarks_Section SHALL expand to show all Benchmark_Tables as sub-items
3. WHEN the Benchmarks section is expanded and clicked again, THE Benchmarks_Section SHALL collapse to hide the sub-items
4. THE Benchmarks_Section SHALL include the following Table_Links: VTI Compliance, VTI DPMO, TA Idle Time, Seal Validation Accuracy %, PPO Compliance, and Andon Response Time
5. THE Quick_Navigation_System SHALL display the TOM Team Leaderboard as a separate navigation item outside the Benchmarks section

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want to click on table names in the navigation and be taken directly to that table on the page, so that I can quickly access specific data sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on any Table_Links within the Benchmarks section, THE Quick_Navigation_System SHALL scroll directly to the corresponding table section
2. WHEN a user clicks on the TOM Team Leaderboard link, THE Quick_Navigation_System SHALL scroll directly to the leaderboard section
3. WHEN scrolling to a table section, THE Quick_Navigation_System SHALL position the table header clearly visible at the top of the viewport
4. THE Quick_Navigation_System SHALL complete the scroll animation within 1 second
5. WHEN a table link is clicked, THE Quick_Navigation_System SHALL automatically collapse after navigation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want functional "Go to Top" and "Go to Bottom" buttons, so that I can quickly navigate to the beginning or end of the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Scroll_Buttons SHALL be visible and positioned on the right side of the screen
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Go to Top" button, THE Quick_Navigation_System SHALL smoothly scroll to the top of the page
3. WHEN a user clicks the "Go to Bottom" button, THE Quick_Navigation_System SHALL smoothly scroll to the bottom of the page
4. THE Scroll_Buttons SHALL complete the scroll animation within 1 second
5. THE Scroll_Buttons SHALL remain functional and visible at all times during page interaction
