# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the TOM Analytics Dashboard to automatically hide columns that have no data, providing a cleaner user interface when only partial data is available (e.g., only current month data without prior month data).

## Glossary

- **Dashboard**: The TOM Analytics Dashboard web application
- **Prior Month Column**: The table column displaying previous month's performance data
- **Change Column**: The table column showing the difference between prior and current month
- **Current Month Column**: The table column displaying current month's performance data

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want columns with no data to be automatically hidden, so that the table is cleaner and easier to read when I only have partial data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no prior month data exists for any row in a table, THE Dashboard SHALL hide the "Prior Month" column header and all corresponding cells
2. WHEN no prior month data exists for any row in a table, THE Dashboard SHALL hide the "Change" column header and all corresponding cells
3. WHEN prior month data exists for at least one row in a table, THE Dashboard SHALL display both "Prior Month" and "Change" columns
4. WHEN columns are hidden due to missing data, THE Dashboard SHALL maintain proper table layout and alignment
5. WHEN new data is uploaded that includes prior month values, THE Dashboard SHALL automatically show the previously hidden columns
