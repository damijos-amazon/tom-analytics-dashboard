# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses a comprehensive bug fix and quality assurance initiative for the TOM Analytics Dashboard application. The system is a complex web application that manages employee performance data across multiple tables with drag-and-drop file upload, dynamic table generation, database synchronization, and leaderboard calculations. The goal is to eliminate all bugs, ensure all buttons work correctly, and verify that all components are properly wired together.

## Glossary

- **TOM Dashboard**: The main application class that manages individual performance tables
- **Dashboard Manager**: System that manages multiple TOMDashboard instances
- **Config System**: Table Configuration System that manages table metadata
- **File Routing Engine**: Component that routes uploaded files to appropriate tables
- **Dynamic Table Generator**: Component that generates HTML table structures from configuration
- **Config Modal**: UI component for managing table configurations
- **Supabase**: Backend database service for data persistence
- **Leaderboard**: Unified ranking system across all performance tables

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: File Upload and Routing System

**User Story:** As a manager, I want to upload Excel/CSV/JSON files via drag-and-drop or file picker, so that the data is automatically routed to the correct performance table.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags a file over the upload area, THE System SHALL display visual feedback indicating the drop zone is active
2. WHEN a user drops one or more files onto the upload area, THE System SHALL process each file and route it to the appropriate table based on filename patterns
3. WHEN a user clicks the upload area, THE System SHALL open the file picker dialog
4. WHEN a user selects files through the file picker, THE System SHALL process each file identically to dropped files
5. WHEN the File Routing Engine receives a file, THE System SHALL match the filename against configured patterns and route to the highest priority matching table
6. IF no pattern matches the filename, THEN THE System SHALL route the file to the default table
7. WHEN a file is successfully processed, THE System SHALL display a success message indicating the number of records loaded and the target table name
8. IF a file processing error occurs, THEN THE System SHALL display an error message with details

### Requirement 2: Table Rendering and Data Display

**User Story:** As a manager, I want all performance tables to render correctly with accurate data, so that I can review employee performance metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is loaded into a table, THE System SHALL calculate performance changes between prior and current month values
2. WHEN rendering a table row, THE System SHALL display rank, employee name, prior month value, current month value, change percentage, status, and action buttons
3. WHEN the direction is "higher", THE System SHALL mark positive changes as improvements and negative changes as declines
4. WHEN the direction is "lower", THE System SHALL mark negative changes as improvements and positive changes as declines
5. WHEN a table has no data, THE System SHALL display an empty state message
6. WHEN data changes occur, THE System SHALL automatically re-render the affected table
7. WHEN rendering completes, THE System SHALL update the corresponding podium with top 3 performers

### Requirement 3: Drag-and-Drop Row Reordering

**User Story:** As a manager, I want to manually reorder table rows by dragging them, so that I can customize the ranking display.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts dragging a table row, THE System SHALL reduce the row opacity to 0.5 to indicate dragging state
2. WHEN a user drags a row over another row, THE System SHALL provide visual feedback for drop position

4. WHEN row reordering completes, THE System SHALL update the internal data array to match the new visual order
5. WHEN row reordering completes, THE System SHALL update rank numbers to reflect the new order
6. WHEN row reordering completes, THE System SHALL persist the new order to storage
7. WHEN row reordering completes, THE System SHALL display a success message

### Requirement 4: Dashboard Manager Integration

5. WHEN a table visibility is toggled to visible, THE System SHALL regenerate the HTML and restore the data
6. WHEN a table is deleted, THE System SHALL archive the data to localStorage with a timestamp and remove the dashboard instance
7. WHEN a table configuration is updated, THE System SHALL refresh the table while preserving existing data

### Requirement 5: Configuration Modal Functionality

4. WHEN an "Edit" button is clicked for a table, THE System SHALL populate the form with that table's configuration
5. WHEN the form is submitted with valid data, THE System SHALL save the configuration to localStorage and Supabase
6. WHEN a table is saved, THE System SHALL trigger a configuration update event
7. WHEN a "Delete" button is clicked, THE System SHALL prompt for confirmation before deleting
8. WHEN a table is deleted, THE System SHALL archive its data and remove it from the configuration
9. WHEN a "Hide/Show" button is clicked, THE System SHALL toggle the table's visibility and update the UI accordingly
10. WHEN the modal is closed, THE System SHALL apply any configuration changes to the live dashboard

### Requirement 6: Leaderboard Calculation and Display

**User Story:** As a manager, I want to see a unified leaderboard that ranks employees across all performance tables, so that I can identify top performers.
